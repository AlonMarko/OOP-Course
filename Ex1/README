Patron.java - the patron class file
Book.java - the book class file
Library.java - the library class file

Design:
everything follows the API and there arent any significant addons to it. so it is pretty straight forward.

implementation issues:
i did use the listarray from collections. and it caused some issues and things i had to "go around" since i guess we were 
supposed to use regular lists with fixed length and maybe use the index as indicators (ID). i used the hashcode for 
an object as id since it is uniqe.
